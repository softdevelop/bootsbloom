1- When user was logged out when he clicked on "reset it here" in the email, process is working fine, like on the left. But (to do: 1)when user is logged in on bb when he clicks on "reset it here", user is not directed to step 9, this process is not working, can you please solve it?

2- After User deletes his account, User cannot sign in again neither using fb nor using sign in form (error message appears telling him to “contact Admin to reactivate his account”, this is ok.). But (to do 2) there is no way for Admin to reactivate this deleted account, which can be an issue if User closed his account without deleting his pledge.Can you please solve it?

3- this is not working, pledges are not cancelled after Admin cancels project from Admin panel: when Backer clicks on “manage my pledge” (he is directed to “manage my pledge after creator cancelled.jpg” page), which is wrong. Backer should be directed to “cancelled pledge page.jpg” like in II/B/1/b. Can you please fix this and make sure the pledge is cancelled as it works now in II/B/1/b?

4- Backers receive a notification email telling them Creator has canceled his project (to do 4 this notification email exists in “project_cancellation_to_backer.ctp” but process is not working, can you please fix this too?)


5- add a notification in activity (on top of homescreen of backer) saying that “Backed project has been cancelled” like in activity.jpg


6- Creators are notified by email that their project was exceptionally cancelled by Admin and that such behavior is not recommended (to do 6: can you please add such a process)
